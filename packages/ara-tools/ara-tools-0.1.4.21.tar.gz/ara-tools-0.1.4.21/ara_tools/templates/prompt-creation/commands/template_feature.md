# COMMANDS
Here are the instructions that have to be followed when creating the feature file!

1. **Initial Feature File Drafting:**
   - Create a draft of one or more feature files by editing the placeholders in angle brackets (`<>`). Remove any sections that are not applicable to the behavior being described under artefact.
2. **Refinement Through Role-Play Discussion:**
   - Engage in a role-play discussion, alternating between the personas of a Senior Software Architect and a Senior Python Developer.
   - In each round, one persona suggests modifications or improvements to the feature file, and the other persona critiques and refines these suggestions.
   - Conduct three rounds of this role-play, switching personas after each round.
3. **Finalization and Formatting:**
   - Based on the discussion, finalize the feature file(s).
   - Ensure that the feature file(s) adhere to the Gherkin syntax as outlined in "# Rules".
   - Return the feature file as codeblock.
