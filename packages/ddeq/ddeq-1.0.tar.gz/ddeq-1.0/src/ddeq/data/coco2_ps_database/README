This dataset contains a global emission catalogue of CO2 and co-emitted species
(NOx, SO2, CO, CH4) from thermal power plants for the year 2018. The dataset
contains annual emission information for individual thermal power plants a
their exact geographical location. Each facility is linked to a specific
temporal (i.e., monthly, day-of-the-week and hourly) and vertical distribution
profile to derive spatial- and temporal-resolved emissions for modelling
efforts.

The dataset was produced as part of the CoCO2 project, which has received
funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme
under grant agreement No 958927.
