A Python package aiming to provide an easy and efficient interface to various implementations of the [Hexagonal Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_fast_Fourier_transform). The purpose of the software is primarily educational with a goal of eventually reaching production quality.

For now the `fft()` and `ifft()` methods implement the HFFT algorithm due to Mersereau in
