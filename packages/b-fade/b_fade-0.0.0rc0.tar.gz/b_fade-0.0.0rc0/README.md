# B-FADE: Bayesian FAtigue moDel Estimator

The package implements Maximum a Posteriori Estimation (MAP) to accomplish the estimation of fatigue models' parameters. Currently the package is designed to identify the El Haddad (EH) curve given a fatigue & defectivity characterisation dataset. Other curves are forseen in future developments.

## Features

- Maximum a Posteriori Estimation and computation of the predictive posterior.
- Monte Carlo Estimation of the prediction interval for the considered curve.
- Data pre-processing & visualisation.

## Quick Setup

B-FADE is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) at (**add link when available**), therefore it can be installed using common package managers, such as `pip` or `conda`:

```
pip install --user b-fade
```

```
conda install b-fade
```

For further instructions, please take a look at the documentation.
