# Tölvera

[Tölvera](https://tolvera.is) is a library for exploring musical performance with artificial life (ALife) and self-organising systems. The word is an Icelandic [kenning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenning):

- Tölva = computer, from tala (number) + völva (prophetess)
- Vera = being
- Tölvera = number being

Tölvera is written in [Taichi](https://www.taichi-lang.org/), a domain-specific language embedded in Python.

This is experimental software and everything is currently subject to change.

## Features

- `tv.v`: a collection of "vera" (beings) including Move, Flock, Slime and Swarm, with more being continuously added. Vera can be combined and composed in various ways.
- `tv.p`: extensible particle system. Particles are divided into multiple species, where each species has a unique relationship with every other species, including itself
- `tv.s`: n-dimensional state structures that can be used by "vera", including built-in OSC and IML creation (see below).
- `tv.px`: drawing library including various shapes and blend modes, styled similarly to p5.js etc.
- `tv.osc`: Open Sound Control (OSC) via [iipyper](https://github.com/Intelligent-Instruments-Lab/iipyper), including automated export of OSC schemas to JSON, XML, Pure Data (Pd), Max/MSP (SuperCollider TBC).
- `tv.iml`: Interactive Machine Learning via [anguilla](https://github.com/Intelligent-Instruments-Lab/anguilla).
- `tv.ti`: Taichi-based simulation and rendering engine. Can be run "headless" (without graphics).
- `tv.cv`: computer vision integration based on OpenCV and Mediapipe.

## Examples

Examples can be found at [iil-examples/tolvera](https://github.com/Intelligent-Instruments-Lab/iil-examples/tree/main/tolvera).
When run as a script, Tölvera program looks like this:

```py
from tolvera import Tolvera, run

def main(**kwargs):
    tv = Tolvera(**kwargs)

    @tv.render
    def _():
        return tv.px

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run(main)
```

## Install

Taichi [supports numerous operating systems and backends](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/hello_world#supported-systems-and-backends).
If you plan on using Vulkan for graphics (recommended for macOS), you may need to [install the Vulkan SDK](https://docs.taichi-lang.org/docs/hello_world#supported-systems-and-backends) first and restart your machine.

Tölvera is [registered on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tolvera) and can be installed via a Python package manager such as `pip`:

```sh
pip install tolvera
```

## Develop

Fork/clone this repository and install the package with `poetry`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Intelligent-Instruments-Lab/tolvera # (or clone your own fork)
cd tolvera
poetry install
```
