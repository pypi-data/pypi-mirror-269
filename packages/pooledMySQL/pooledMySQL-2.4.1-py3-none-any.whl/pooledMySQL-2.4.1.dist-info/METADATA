# pooledMySQL v2.4.1

```pip install pooledMySQL --upgrade```

###### <br>A well maintained program to have MySQL connection pool which auto-scales infinitely as required. This would help remove problems caused by multithreading, also removed user hassle of manually creating and deleting connections manually.


<br>To install: 
```
pip install pooledMySQL --upgrade
pip3 install pooledMySQL --upgrade
python -m pip install pooledMySQL --upgrade
python3 -m pip install pooledMySQL --upgrade
```


#### <br><br>Using this program is as simple as:
```
from pooledMySQL import Manager as MySQLManager

executorMySQL = MySQLManager("root", "SomePassword", "DatabaseName")

listOfTuples = executorMySQL.execute("SELECT * from someTable")

for individualTuple in listOfTuples:
    print(individualTuple[0])
```


### <br>Future implementations:
