# transceiver

transceiver is a Python library that swiftly exchanges complex data structures such as numpy arrays and PIL images between processes, optimizing AI inference tasks that utilize ComfyUI.

## why?

When processing a large number of requests, the SaveImage and LoadImage nodes may be IO-limited, and using shared memory improves performance by passing images only through memory access, not through IO.

## install

```
cd /path/to/ComfyUI
source venv/bin/activate
cd custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/nat-chan/comfyui-in-memory-transceiver
cd comfyui-in-memory-transceiver
pip install -e .
cd ../.. # cd /path/to/ComfyUI
python main.py # launch
```
