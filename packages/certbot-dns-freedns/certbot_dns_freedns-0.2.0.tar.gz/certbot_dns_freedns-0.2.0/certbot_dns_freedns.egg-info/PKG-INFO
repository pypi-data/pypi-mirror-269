certbot-dns-freedns
===================

FreeDNS - DNS Authenticator plugin for Certbot

This plugin automates the process of completing a ``dns-01`` challenge
by creating, and subsequently removing, TXT records using the FreeDNS
Remote API.

Installation
------------

.. code:: bash

   pip install certbot-dns-freedns

Named Arguments
---------------

To start using DNS authentication for freedns, pass the following
arguments on certbot’s command line:

+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| --authenticator dns-freedns       | select the authenticator plugin    |
|                                   | (Required)                         |
+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| --dns-freedns-credentials         | freedns Remote User credentials    |
|                                   | INI file. (Required)               |
+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| --dns-freedns-propagation-seconds | waiting time for DNS to propagate  |
|                                   | before asking the ACME server to   |
|                                   | verify the DNS record. (Default:   |
|                                   | 120, Recommended: >= 600)          |
+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------+

..

   (Note that the verbose and seemingly redundant
   ``certbot-dns-freedns:`` prefix is currently imposed by certbot for
   external plugins.)

Credentials
-----------

An example ``credentials.ini`` file:

.. code:: ini

   dns_freedns_username = myremoteuser
   dns_freedns_password = verysecureremoteuserpassword

The path to this file can be provided interactively or using
the\ ``--dns-freedns-credentials`` command-line argument. Certbot
records the path to this file for use during renewal, but does not store
the file’s contents.

**CAUTION:** You should protect these API credentials as you would the
password to your freedns account. Users who can read this file can use
these credentials to issue arbitrary API calls on your behalf. Users who
can cause Certbot to run using these credentials can complete a
``dns-01`` challenge to acquire new certificates or revoke existing
certificates for associated domains, even if those domains aren’t being
managed by this server.

Certbot will emit a warning if it detects that the credentials file can
be accessed by other users on your system. The warning reads “Unsafe
permissions on credentials configuration file”, followed by the path to
the credentials file. This warning will be emitted each time Certbot
uses the credentials file, including for renewal, and cannot be silenced
except by addressing the issue (e.g., by using a command like
``chmod 600`` to restrict access to the file).

Examples
~~~~~~~~

To acquire a single certificate for both ``example.com`` and
``*.example.com``, waiting 900 seconds for DNS propagation:

.. code:: bash

   certbot certonly \
     --authenticator dns-freedns \
     --dns-freedns-credentials /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets/domain.tld.ini \
     --dns-freedns-propagation-seconds 900 \
     --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
     --agree-tos \
     --rsa-key-size 4096 \
     -d 'example.com' \
     -d '*.example.com'

Docker
~~~~~~

In order to create a docker container with a certbot-dns-freedns
installation, create an empty directory with the following
``Dockerfile``:

.. code:: docker

   FROM certbot/certbot
   RUN pip install certbot-dns-freedns

Proceed to build the image:

.. code:: bash

   docker build -t certbot/dns-freedns .

Once that’s finished, the application can be run as follows:

.. code:: bash

   docker run --rm \
     -v /var/lib/letsencrypt:/var/lib/letsencrypt \
     -v /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt \
     --cap-drop=all \
     certbot/dns-freedns certonly \
     --authenticator dns-freedns \
     --dns-freedns-propagation-seconds 900 \
     --dns-freedns-credentials \
     /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets/domain.tld.ini \
     --no-self-upgrade \
     --keep-until-expiring --non-interactive --expand \
     --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \
     -d example.com -d '*.example.com'

It is suggested to secure the folder as follows:

.. code:: bash

   chown root:root /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets
   chmod 600 /etc/letsencrypt/.secrets
