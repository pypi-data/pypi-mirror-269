# Book Recommendation Project
This is the final project of the DS 223 Marketing Analytics class at the American University of Armenia (AUA) during the Spring 2024 semester.

## Project Overview
The Book Recommendation project aims to create a book recommendation system for bookstores. When a customer requests a book that is currently unavailable, the system will utilize machine learning techniques to find similar books based on attributes such as genre, author, and book description. This will help bookstores enhance customer satisfaction and increase sales by offering relevant alternatives.
