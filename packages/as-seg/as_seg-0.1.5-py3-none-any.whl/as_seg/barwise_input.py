Module used to handle compute the Barwise TF matrix, presented in [1]
(Barwise TF matrix: a 2D representation of barwise features, 
each feature representing Time-Frequency content, where time is expressed at barscale)

See [1 - Chapter 2.4] or [2] for more information.

# %% Tensors barwise spectrograms construction
# !!! Be extremely careful with the organization of modes, which can be either Frequency-Time at barscale-Bars (FTB) or Bars-Frequency-Time at barscale (BFT) depending on the method.
def tensorize_barwise_BFT(spectrogram, bars, hop_length_seconds, subdivision):
    """
    Returns a 3rd order tensor-spectrogram from the original spectrogram and bars starts and ends.
    The order of modes is Bars-Frequency-Time at barscale (BFT).
    Must be used for SSAE and the computtion of Barwise TF matrix.
    
    Each bar in the tensor-spectrogram contains the same number of frames, define by the "subdivision" parameter.
    These frames are selected from an oversampled spectrogram, adapting to the specific size of each bar.
    See [1] for details.

        The spectrogram to return as a tensor-spectrogram.

    hop_length_seconds : float
        The hop_length, in seconds.
    subdivision : integer
        The number of subdivision of the bar to be contained in each slice of the tensor.

    -------
    np.array tensor
        The tensor-spectrogram as a np.array.
