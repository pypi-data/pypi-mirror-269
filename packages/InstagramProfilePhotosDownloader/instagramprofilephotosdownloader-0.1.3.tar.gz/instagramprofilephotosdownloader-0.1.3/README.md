A simple scraping tool to download an Instagram profile's photos.

### Dependencies
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) ([LICENSE](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/trunk/LICENSE))
- [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ([LICENSE](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/LICENSE))

### Usage
The package provides the simple console script with two entry points upon installation: `InstagramProfilePhotosDownloader` and `ippd`.

Two commands are available:
- `ippd urls_file scrape` is used to scrape some posts images links and save the URLs in a text file, uses _Selenium_
- `ippd urls_file download` is used to download the images with simple _Requests_ HTTP GET

This tool is intended to be used by people who know how scraping and HTTP works, meaning the `-h` help option (and the small size of the code) is more than enough to understand where to get the required arguments.
