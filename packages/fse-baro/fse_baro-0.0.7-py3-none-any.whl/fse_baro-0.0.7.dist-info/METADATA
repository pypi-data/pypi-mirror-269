# BARO: Robust Root Cause Analysis for Microservices via Multivariate Bayesian Online Change Point Detection

[![pypi package](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/fse-baro.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/fse-baro)
[![Build and test](https://github.com/phamquiluan/baro/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/phamquiluan/baro/actions/workflows/build-and-test.yml)


In the progress of preparing the Artifact submission:
- Deadline 30/4
- https://2024.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2024-artifacts#submission-for-replicated-and-reproduced-badges
- Can apply for all three badges: Available, Function, Reusable

**Functional: The artifacts associated with the research are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.	
**

**Reusable: Functional + the artifacts associated with the paper are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. They are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to.	
**

TODO:

- [x] reproduce RobustScorer
- [ ] reproduce BOCPD
- [ ] make docs directly on readme, show available AD + RCA methods + tutorials
- [ ] make the API
- [ ] restructure + lint code
- [ ] better readme
- [ ] make a Helm chart

## Installation

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fse-baro)

```bash
pip install fse-baro
