## Typing stubs for regex

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`regex`](https://github.com/mrabarnett/mrab-regex) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`regex`.

This version of `types-regex` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `regex==2024.4.16`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/regex. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `7858e6058b51733f526c6c54035b96a370a12ffc` and was tested
with mypy 1.9.0, pyright 1.1.358, and
pytype 2024.4.11.
