call_to_change is a package that works with our web app (CallToChange) to help you offset LLM emissions.

To use call_to_change, create an OpenAI client, and call the log function on the client. Include your CallToChange email.

client = OpenAI()
log(client, 'youremail@email.com')

We do everything on our end to update LLM call tracking.
