def analyse_annotations(annotation):
    """Analyse the string `annotation` which compactly sets the properties of a label string such as
    position, size and color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    annotation : str
        label[@(xp, yp)[s10][a0][cRRGGBB]]

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of strings and integers
        text (str), x position (float) y position (float), color (str), size (int), axis (int)

    Notes
    -----
    * The annotation string can be just given a a label. This label optionally can be extended
      with a '@' sign to include more information, like the location (xp, yp), the size with s10,
      the color with c and the axis with a and a integer

    * The annotation format is mostly used as a compact way to provide information on the annotation
      via a user input file

    * When specifying a color with the c construct, make sure that you put the color at the end of
      the *annotation* string.

    * In the Parameter scription we used a hex formulation for the color like cFFAA00. However,
      also the color names like cblue or cred are allowed

    * In case you add chmc:red, the hmc definition of red will be used. Other hmc color
      definitions are:

         - blue
         - lightblue
         - red
         - lightred
         - green
         - darkcyan

    * Also we can add the xkcd_ color definitions as described in the matplotlib_ manual

    .. _xkcd:
        https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/

    .. _matplotlib:
        https://matplotlib.org/users/colors.html

    Examples
    --------

    Simple example of a label with all the properties set to default

    >>> analyse_annotations("simple_label")
    ('simple_label', 0.0, 0.0, 'black', 12, 0)

    place a label at position x=0.1, y=0.4

    >>> analyse_annotations("more_complex@0.1,0.4")
    ('more_complex', 0.1, 0.4, 'black', 12, 0)

    place a label at position x=0.8, y=0.9 with color red. Note that we need to add brackets
    around the location

    >>> analyse_annotations("colored_label@(0.8,0.9)cred")
    ('colored_label', 0.8, 0.9, 'red', 12, 0)

    place a label at position x=0.8, y=0.9 with color red. Note that we need to add brackets
    around the location

    >>> analyse_annotations("small_label@(0.8,0.9)s8")
    ('small_label', 0.8, 0.9, 'black', 8, 0)

    Place a label at position x=0.8, y=0.9 with color red and size 16. This time we need
    to add the color label at the end to extract it correcly

    >>> analyse_annotations("large_colored_label_in_axis_2@(0.8,0.9)s16a2cred")
    ('large_colored_label_in_axis_2', 0.8, 0.9, 'red', 16, 2)

    Finally lets show how you use more colours

    >>> analyse_annotations("label@(0.8,0.9)s16a2chmc:red")
    ('label', 0.8, 0.9, '#DD2E1A', 16, 2)

    As you can see, the hex code of HMC read is returned.

    To set the xkcd colors do

    >>> analyse_annotations("label@(0.8,0.9)s16a2cxkcd:red")
    ('label', 0.8, 0.9, 'xkcd:red', 16, 2)

    This color value 'xkcd:red' is understood by all matplotlib routines

def clean_up_artists(axis, artist_list):
    """Remove all the artists stored in the `artist_list` belonging to the `axis`.


    Parameters
    ----------
    axis : :class:matplotlib.axes.Axes
        Clean Artists (ie. items added to a matplotlib plot) belonging to this axis
    artist_list : list
        List of artist to remove.

    Notes
    -----

    In case of animation of complex plots with contours and labels (such as a timer) we sometimes
    need to take care of removing all the Artists which are changing every time step.
    This function takes care of that. It also also ensured that we are not running out of memory

    Create a list which we use to store all the artists which need to be cleaned

    Create a plot of some random data

    >>> fig, ax = subplots(ncols=1, nrows=1)
    >>> data = random_sample((20, 30))
    >>> cs = ax.contourf(data)

    Store the contour Artist in a list

def sub_plot_axis_to_2d(axis, n_rows=1, n_cols=1):
    """
    Turn the axis return value of matplotlibs subfigures in a 2D list, regardless of the number of
    rows and columns

    Parameters
    ----------
    axis : list or :class:matplotlib.axes.Axes
        Axes object or list of axis objects as return by the matplotlib subplots command
    n_rows : int, optional, default: 1
        The number of rows of the current plot
    n_cols : int, optional, default: 1
        number of columns of the current plot

    Returns
    -------
    type: list
        new 2D list of the axis  which can be referred to as `axis[i_row][j_col]`

    Notes
    -----

    The return axis of the *matplotlib.subplots* command is 2D in the case we have more than one row
    and more than one column. However, if there is only one row or col then the list will be 1D,
    for *n_col = 1* and *n_row = 1* the axis are directly returned. This scrips ensures that the
    list is always started as a 2D list such that the axis can be referred to with two indices:
    *axis[i_row][j_col]*, also if we only have on row or columns

    The practical usage of this function is to be able to write more generic code for which it is
    not known before hand how many rows and columns need to be generated (it may depend on the user
    input).

    Examples
    --------

    First create a *matplotlib* plot with only one row of two column

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from numpy import (sin, cos, pi, linspace)
    >>> fig, axis = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

    At this point, *axis* is a 1D list of 2 *matplotlib.axis.Axes* objects, one for each column.
    So we can plot like this

    >>> x = linspace(0, 2 * pi, num=100)
    >>> l0 = axis[0].plot(x, sin(x))
    >>> l1 = axis[1].plot(x, cos(x))

    Now we want to turn that into a 2D list

    >>> axis_2d = sub_plot_axis_to_2d(axis, n_cols=2)

    Now, axis2d is a 2D list of Axes for 2 columns which are referred as axis[0][0] and axis[0][1],
    so we can plot

    >>> l2d0 = axis_2d[0][0].plot(x, sin(x))
    >>> l2d1 = axis_2d[0][1].plot(x, cos(x))

    Note that we are referring to *axis_2d* as a 2D list with 2 indices in stead of one.
    This allows to create plots on the subplots returned axis in always the same way, which is handy
    if we don't know beforehand how many rows and columns we have.
