    A collection of functions and classes for marine sea state modelling

This packages supplies several wave field models which can be used for marine applications.


===========
Information
===========

This projects gives a collection of spectral functions. It comes with the following modules

* wave_spectra : A set of functions to create wave spectra and distribution functions
* wave_fields : Create and simulate 1D and 2D waves based on the *wave_spectra* module
