          narrow width of the spectrum
        * "dnv": Hs and Tp define energy of spectrum and peak location, respectively.
          The width of the gauss is explicitly defined by the sigma input argument and
          does not depend on Tp

    Notes
    -----
    * The benefit of the 'sim' spectral version is that the width does not need to be
      defined: it follows automatically from the Tp values (larger Tp leads to a more
      narrow width of the spectrum)
    * The 'dnv' definition allows to set the width explicitly via the *sigma* input
      argument. This allows better control over the width of the spectrum yourself.
      It can also be used to define a spectrum which has all its energy focused into one
      signal frequency bin by setting sigma to a very small value such as 1e-6.

    * This function create a the complex spectral amplitudes on a wave vector mesh where
      the spectrum magnitude is based on a Jonswap of Gauss power spectral density and
      the phase is generated with a random generator.
    * The mesh is cartesian, therefore only the x and y axis of the wave vector space
      have to be passed.
    * The returned complex amplitudes have to be passed to the fft2d in order to
      calculate the wave height in the spatial domain.
      For that reason it is ensured that the complex amplitude are point symmetric
      around k=0 such that A(-k) = A^*(k) which is required to use the FFT
    * The k-mesh must be defined such that the positive frequency are stored in the
      first half of the array and the negative frequencies are stored swapped on the
      second half of the array
      See for the details:
      https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.fft.fftfreq.html

    Examples
    --------

    This example shows how to create the complex spetral amplitudes and how to use that
    to calculate a wave surface. First, let's create the complex amplitude on based on
    a jonswap spectrum

    >>> L = 1000
    >>> nx = 64
    >>> ny = 64
    >>> dx = L / nx
    >>> dy = L / ny
    >>> kx_nodes = 2 * np.pi * np.fft.fftfreq(nx, dx)
    >>> ky_nodes = 2 * np.pi * np.fft.fftfreq(ny, dy)
    >>> ak, os = spectrum2d_complex_amplitudes(kx_nodes=kx_nodes, ky_nodes=ky_nodes,
    ...                                        Theta_0=0.0, Hs=2.3, Tp=12.2, gamma=3.3,
    ...                                        Theta_s_spread_kx=5.0, seed=1)

    Use Parseval's theorem to get the variance of the calculated Fourier components and
    turn it into a wave height using hs = 4 sqrt(variance). Note that we divide by 2,
    because the k-domain stores the amplitude mirrored over k=0 so each component is
    stored twice

    >>> hs_estimate = 4 * np.sqrt(np.square(abs(ak)).sum()) / 2
    >>> print("Hs = {:.1f} m".format(hs_estimate))
    Hs = 2.3 m

    Indeed we can see that the hs obtained from the complex amplitudes correspond with
    our target Hs

    The complex amplitudes can be used to calculate the wave surface at a certain
    time t. To do that first you need to convert the wave vector numbers to a angular
    frequency using the deep water dispersion relation

    >>> k_mesh = np.meshgrid(kx_nodes, ky_nodes)
    >>> kk = np.sqrt(k_mesh[0] ** 2 + k_mesh[1] ** 2)
    >>> g0 = 9.81
    >>> omega_dispersion = np.sqrt(g0 * abs(kk)) * os

    Now we have omega belonging to each wave vector we can calculate the amplitude of
    the surface

    >>> n_nodes = int(ak.size / 2)
    >>> for time in np.linspace(start=0, stop=10, num=6):
    ...    amplitudes = n_nodes * np.fft.ifft2(ak) * np.exp(1j * (-time * os))
    ...    hs_et2 = 4 * np.std(amplitudes)
    ...    print("time = {} s  Hs = {:.1f} m".format(time, hs_estimate))
    time = 0.0 s  Hs = 2.3 m
    time = 2.0 s  Hs = 2.3 m
    time = 4.0 s  Hs = 2.3 m
    time = 6.0 s  Hs = 2.3 m
    time = 8.0 s  Hs = 2.3 m
    time = 10.0 s  Hs = 2.3 m

    The wave surface over the domain of 1000 x 1000 m2 is stored in *amplitudes*.
    The wave height Hs estimated with 4*variance indeed is 2.3 for all time steps
