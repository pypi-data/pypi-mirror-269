    "##### wave model and mesh resolution\n",
    "This section gives some backgroud on the wave field modelling implemented in the *wave_field* model package The wave_package gives a more eleborate discussion, but in short here,  we discuss in the modelling of 1D propagating waves (or 2D Waves if you count time as a dimension). The following equation is solved\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\eta(x_p, t) = \\sum_i^{n_k} a_i \\cos(k_i x_p - \\omega_i t + \\phi_i)~~~~~p=1,2\\dots,n_x$$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\eta$ is the wave height at the position $x_p$ on $n_x$ descrite points, $a_i$ is the amplitude of the wave component $i$, $k_i$ is the wave vector belonging to the wave component $i$ and $\\phi_i$ is a random phase between $0\\sim 2\\pi$. The wave amplitudes $a_i$ are set as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_i = \\sqrt{2S(k_i)\\Delta k_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S(k)$ is the underlying wave spectrum we want to impose and $\\Delta k_i$ is the spacing between the wave vector nodes $k_i$ and $k_{i+1}$. The wave spectrum is defined in wave vector space $k$ which is related to the angular frequency via the deep water dispersion relation as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k = \\omega^2/g_0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solution methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The key points of the equation shown above is that in order to model a wave, for the spatial domain $x$ we have to specify a length $L_x$ and number of points $n_x$, and for the wave vector domain $k$ we have to specify a range *k_min*/*k_max* and  number of points $n_k$. Also we need to specify the spectrum, either Jonsswap or Gauss at the moment\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve the wave equation we can either directly implement the wave equation above as a discrete sum of wave components, which is then refered to as a Discrete Fourier Transfor (DFT). The benefit of a DFT is that we are not restricted to how many sample points in wave vector space we have compared to number of points in the spatial domain or what the spacing between the wave vector components is. The draw back is that the DFT is relatively slow as the calculation time increases with $\\sim n_x \\times n_k$. Since we can freely pick the number of wave nodes this latter is not a problem if we reduce the number of wave nodes but off course we get a less accurate discription of the wave spectrum we want to model\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively we can solve the wave equation with an FFT. The restriction for using an FFT is that we have to use as many points in wave vector domain as in spatial domain and our mesh needs to be equidistant. The calculation time of a FFT increases with $\\sim n_x \\log(n_x)$. So incease we want to impose the maximum number of wave components on our mesh (which is when $n_k = n_x$ we still have a relatively fast calculation time compared to the DFT\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we demonstrate how the FFT and DFT can be used to model a 1D wave. The DFT is imposed using the *DPTpolar* mode and allows to select the number of wave components out of the full set by either definnig a sub range or by picking the wave nodes at non-uniform intervals in a ways that each interval has an equal amount of energy. Then we compare the *DFTpolar* method with the *FFT* method. "

In contrast to the wave selection method such as the EqualEnergyBin we do not pay the price in the reduction of the high frequency wave components, but we can still obtain a reduction in simulation time. Note further that the simulation time of a DFT scales with N^2, whereas the FFT scale with Nlog(N), so especially for 2D spectra it is important to pick the most efficient algorithm\n",
