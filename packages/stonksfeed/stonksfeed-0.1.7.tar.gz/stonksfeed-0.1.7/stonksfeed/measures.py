        "name": "Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)",
        "definition": "Compares the price of a stock to its earnings per share (EPS). It indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.",
        "math": "P/E Ratio = Price per Share / Earnings per Share (EPS)",

For instance, a tech company with high growth prospects might have a high P/E ratio as investors are willing to pay more for future earnings.",
