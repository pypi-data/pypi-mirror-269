## Installation

### Dependencies

You need:

* Python 3
* Python 3 PIP
* `openssh-server` : (Optional) in order to enable terminal function for Kriya

Install:

```
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```

### Package installation

To install the package locally, run:

```
pip3 install -e <path-to-the-repo>
```

To install from Python Package Index (PyPI), run:

```
pip3 install cognicept-shell
```

To verify installation, try to run

```
cognicept -h
```

If you get `cognicept: command not found` error, make sure that `~/.local/bin/` is in your `$PATH`. You could run this:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/$USER/.local/bin/
```
and add it to your `.bashrc` file.

### Autocomplete

To set-up autcomplete when using the cognicept shell, run:

```
cognicept config --autocomplete
```
Restart the terminal and autocomplete should be functioning

This will setup python argcomplete globally and may affect other packages. If argcomplete has been setup globally for other project, this setup is not required.

This command essentially calls the function `activate-global-python-argcomplete`

More information about this can be found in https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/#activating-global-completion

## Usage

For details on usage, use

```
cognicept -h
```

### Commands

#### `config`: Configure Cognicept tools

`cognicept-shell` and Cognicept agents are configured in `runtime.env` file typically placed in `~/.cognicept/runtime.env`. The file defines the docker environment used by the Cognicept agents. 

This command allows to inspect and modify the configuration file. You can use parameter `--path` to modify the path to the Cognicept config directory.

To print full configuration, run:

```
cognicept config --read
```

To add new configuration parameter (or modify single value), run:

```
cognicept config --add
```

Variables used by `cognicept-shell`:

* `COGNICEPT_ACCESS_KEY`
* `COGNICEPT_API_URI`
* `COGNICEPT_USER_API_URI`
* `COG_AGENT_CONTAINERS`
* `COG_AGENT_IMAGES`
* `COG_EXTRA_IMAGES` : images to pull from Cognicept and general docker image repositories
* `COG_ORBITTY_ENABLED`
* `COG_ORBITTY_IMAGE`
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: temporary AWS credentials modified by `keyrotate` and needed for `update`
* `COG_ENABLE_SSH`
* `COG_ENABLE_SSH_KEY_AUTH`
* `COG_ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_SSH`
* `COG_SSH_DEFAULT_USER`

To setup `ssh` access from `remote_intervention_agent` to the host machine, run:

```
cognicept config --ssh
```

To setup autocomplete from cognicept shell, run:
```
cognicept config --auto
```

It will generate ssh keys in `~/.cognicept/ssh/` and configures `COG_ENABLE_SSH`, `COG_ENABLE_SSH_KEY_AUTH`, `COG_ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_SSH`, `COG_SSH_DEFAULT_USER` according to the user preferences. If `COG_ENABLE_AUTOMATIC_SSH` is enabled, public key is copied into `~/.ssh/authorized_hosts`; `sudo` access is requested to perform this action.

#### `status`: Get status of Cognicept agents

```
cognicept status
```
Prints status of agents and other containers managed by `cognicept-shell`. Possible values:

* "ONLINE": Everything fine
* "CONTAINER NOT FOUND": Agent/container is not initiated
* "OFFLINE": Container stopped
* "Error": Error accessing API
* "ERROR": Detected error, needs inspection
* "NOT INITIALIZED": Agent is in init state
* "STALE": Agent didn't update within last minute   

#### `version`: Display Cognicept Shell and Container version

```
cognicept version
```
Prints the version of current cognicept shell and other containers version


#### `update`: Update Cognicept tools

Updates images for agents and tools specified in `COG_AGENT_IMAGES` and `COG_EXTRA_IMAGES` config variables. It requires temporary credentials to be valid. If the available disk space is less than 3 GB, the update will not proceed. This check ensures that there is sufficient space for the update to run successfully. For updates to take effect, containers need to be restarted with `restart` command.


To run update in detached mode:
```
cognicept update -d
```
In detached mode, printing of update statuses in muted. Update is run in a seperate process. Update will continue to run even if terminal session is closed.

To update docker images in environment variable `COGNICEPT_EXTRA_IMAGES`
```
cognicept update --image <docker-images-repo>
```

To override the disk space check before pulling images:
```
cognicept update -s
```
the disk space check will be bypassed, and the update will proceed regardless of the available disk space


#### `lastevent`: Display last event log reported by Cognicept agent

Displays last event saved by `cgs_diagnostics_agent` from `~/.cognicept/logs`.

#### `start`/`stop`/`restart`: start/stop/restart cognicept agents

These commands are used to start/stop/restart containers specified in `COG_AGENT_CONTAINERS`/`COG_AGENT_IMAGES`. Certain container names are reserved for Cognicept agents and are preconfigured:

* `cgs_diagnostics_agent`
* `remote_intervention_agent`
* `kriya_watchdog`
* `cgs_diagnostics_ecs_api`
* `cgs_diagnostics_streamer_api`
* `cgs_bagger_server`
* `health_aggregator`
* `diagnostics_aggregator`
* `kopilot`
* `smartplus_sound`
* `map_manager`
* `computer_health_metrics`
* `slamtec_adapter`
* `cam_capture`

Any agent name or image type can be put in the list as long as default command for the image is specified. All containers are started in `host` network mode.

Following are examples for using `start`. `stop` follows same API as `start`. `restart` first calls `stop` and then `stop` .

To start all listed agents `COG_AGENT_CONTAINERS` don't specify any argument:

```
cognicept start
```

To start all agents:

```
cognicept start --agents
```

To start specific agents:

```
cognicept start remote_intervention_agent cgs_diagnostics_agent
```

To run restart in detached mode:

```
cognicept restart -d
```

Detached mode is particularly useful for restarting a cognicept agent remotely. 
In detached mode, progress of restart will not printed. 

To restart and clearing logs
```
cognicept restart --prune
```

#### `keyrotate`: Rotate Cognicept cloud keys

Updates temporary AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) using `COGNICEPT_ACCESS_KEY` from `COGNICEPT_API_URI`. The validity of the credentials is 12 hours. Internet access with HTTPS allowed is needed.

#### `orbitty`: Run Orbitty

TODO

#### `record`: Manage rosbag recording session to start/stop/pause/resume/get status/record all topics

These commands are used to start/stop/pause/resume/get status/record all topics in a rosbag. All the operations are done by running an `exec` command inside the `cgs_bagger_server` container. All bags are typically placed in the `bags` folder of the Cognicept configuration directory: `~/.cognicept/bags/`

To start start a recording session list all topics to be recorded separated by a space and with their `/` prefix:

```
cognicept record --start /odom /cmd_vel /rosout_agg /tf /tf_static
```

To record ALL topics use `--all`:

**NOTE:** rosbags tend to become quite big quite fast especially if there are camera topics. If there is less than 1 GB disk space, the recording self terminates.

```
cognicept record --all
```

To stop a recording session:

```
cognicept record --stop
```

Alternatively, the latest bag recording can be stopped and automatically pushed to the Cognicept cloud with a single command by providing `autopush` value:

```
cognicept record --stop autopush
```

To pause a recording session:

```
cognicept record --pause
```

To resume a recording session:

```
cognicept record --resume
```

To get the status of the current recording:

```
cognicept record --status
```

Status can be `Ready`, `Started`, `Stopped`, `Paused` and `Resumed`.

**NOTE:** A note on the retry mechanisms built in to improve reliability. If the retry mechanism fails, both `cognicept record --start` and `cognicept record --all` will automatically restart the `cgs_bagger_server`. A new recording session needs to be started if this happens. All other commands will just inform that the retry has failed since these are not essential operations for bag recording.

#### `push`: Push data to Cognicept cloud

These commands are used to push data on to the Cognicept cloud.

To push a bag file, specify the name of the bag file:

```
cognicept push --bag sample_recording.bag
```
**NOTE:** Only bags in the dedicated Cognicept configuration `bags` directory, usually `~/.cognicept/bags`, will be detected and uploaded. Bag files in any other location need to be moved to this directory before upload. Bag files generated using the `cognicept record` feature will be automatically placed in the Cognicept configuration `bags` directory.

As a shorthand, you can push the latest bag file recording by not specifying any argument. This will automatically look for the latest bag file by create time and upload it:
```
cognicept push --bag
```

#### `init`: Initiates the runtime.env file with values from the COGNICEPT_USER_API_URI
To initiate a runtime.env file, specify the robot id and organisation id and then provide credentials when prompted

```
cognicept init --robot_id sample_robot --org_id sample_org
Username: sample_username
Password: sample_password (masked)
```

### **Docker-Compose** 
is supported in version `1.6` for cognicept-shell command below:
```
cognicept update/version/start/stop/restart
```

To make it work, you should added an enviroment variable `COG_COMPOSE_FILE` in `~/.cognicept/runtime.env` and specific the file directory of the docker-compose.yaml file, eg
```
COG_COMPOSE_FILE=~/.cognicept/docker-compose.yaml
```

Sample of docker-compose file:
```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  service_name:
    container_name: service_name
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
    - ${HOME}/.cognicept/runtime.env
    image: image_repo
    command: python3 example.py
```
Sample response after running `cognicept version`

### `move`: to move a robot from one organisation to another

The `cognicept move`` command allows you to move a robot to a different organization with the following flags:

* `--robot_id`: Specify the desired robot_id.
* `--old_org_id`: Provide the organization id where the robot is currently residing.
* `--new_org_id`: Indicate the target organization id to which you want to move the robot.
* `--skip`: You can use this flag to specify if you want to skip the moving of any of the following robot data:
  * `map`: Skip moving the map data.
  * `schedule`: Skip moving the schedule data.
  * `waypoint`: Skip moving the waypoint data.

**Example (without skip):**
```
cognicept move --robot_id=<robot_id> --old_org_id=<old_org_id> --new_org_id=<new_org_id>
```
This command will move the specified robot to the new organization without skipping any data.

**Example (with skip):**
```
cognicept move --robot_id=<robot_id> --old_org_id=<old_org_id> --new_org_id=<new_org_id> --skip waypoint map
```
This command will move the robot while skipping the move map and waypoint

#### Getting Robot Online
After moving the robot to the new organization, there are additional steps required to get the robot online. Follow these steps:

Navigate to the terminal connected to the robot.

Run the following command, replacing `<new org id>` and `<new robot id>` with the actual values displayed after running `cognicept move`:

```
cognicept init --org_id <new org id> --robot_id <new robot id>
```

This command updates the `runtime.env` configuration file inside the robot with its new robot_code, site_code, agent_id, cognicept_access_key, and aws_webrtc_channel_arn.

Run the `cognicept keyrotate` command.

Run the `cognicept restart` command. Note: by default it is restart in detach mode.

After completing these steps, wait for a few minutes, and the robot should be online in the new organization.
