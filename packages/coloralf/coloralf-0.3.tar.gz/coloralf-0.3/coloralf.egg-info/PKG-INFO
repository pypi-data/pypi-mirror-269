```python
import coloralf as c
```

## All transformation : 

For see all transformation, you can execute : 
```python
c.test()
```
I write all in details at the end of this description.


## Usage :

You can mainly use coloralf in two way : in a f-string or as print function.

### In a f-string :

It's a easy way to make print with different colors. For exemple : 
For write "Ce chat mignon s'apelle Chouquette" with :
* `Ce` in red
* `chat` with a yellow background
* `mignon` in italic
* `Chouquette` in underline and light magenta
You can : 
```python
print(f"{c.r}Ce{c.d} {c.by}chat{c.d} {c.ti}mignon{c.d} s'apelle {c.m}{c.tu}Chouqette{c.d}")
```

You can change color, back, etc., and combine transformation. (You can notice the `c.d`, is for delete/reset all transformation)

### In print function :

It's a quick way to use coloralf. You can directly print a sentence (str) with the wanted transformation : just need to add 'f' before the transformation-code. Excemple : 
For write "Super librairie" in red : 
```python
c.fr("Super librairie")
```

If you want several transformations, you can use the `f` function : 
For write "Encore un exemple ..." in underlined (tu), red (r), blink (tb), with green back :
```python
c.f("Encore un exemple ...", 'tu.r.tb.bg')
```
It's just a combinaison of all transformation-codes join by a `.`



## List of all transformations :

* FOR PRINT FUNCTION : add a `f` before the transformation-code
* FOR COLOR : a lighter color, add a `l` before the color-code
* FOR FORMAT : to reset, replace the `t` by `r`
* FOR RESET ALL : `c.d` or `c.ra` or `c.rall`
