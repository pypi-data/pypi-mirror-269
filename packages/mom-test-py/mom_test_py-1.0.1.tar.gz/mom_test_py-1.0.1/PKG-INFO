### Supported Python Versions

- Python 3.11


## Installation

Install from PyPi using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/), a
package manager for Python.

```shell
pip3 install plasgate
```

### Test your installation

Try sending yourself an SMS message. Save the following code sample to your computer with a text editor. Be sure to update the `account_sid`, `auth_token`, and `from_` phone number with values from your [Twilio account](https://console.twilio.com). The `to` phone number will be your own mobile phone.

```python
from twilio.rest import Client

# Your Account SID and Auth Token from console.twilio.com
account_sid = "ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
auth_token  = "your_auth_token"

client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

message = client.messages.create(
    to="+15558675309",
    from_="+15017250604",
    body="Hello from Python!")

print(message.sid)
```

Save the file as `send_sms.py`. In the terminal, `cd` to the directory containing the file you just saved then run:

```shell
python3 send_sms.py
```

After a brief delay, you will receive the text message on your phone.
