# RandomCarrot (Carrot)

Carrot is a module for Python also know as RandomCarrot.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Carrot.

```bash
pip install RandomCarrot
```

## Usage

Importing is very easy in Carrot. All you need to do is type: 
 ```Python
import carrot
```
To display random numbers type:
 ```Python
carrot.randomnumber()
```
To display random letters:
 ```Python
carrot.randomletters()
```
You can adjust length for letters by typing: 
```Python
carrot(length=)
```
To display both numbers and letters:
 ```Python
carrot.both()
``` 
(again you can adjust length by typing the same text like in letters)

## Developer Usage

If you want to use developer commands, feel free to use them! Everyone can use them, even if you just want to see how do they work.
If you want to try using ``carrot.randomnumber()`` like a developer, here is the code:
 ```Python
carrot.random_number_generator()
```
If you want to try using ``carrot.randomletter()`` like a developer, here is the code:
 ```Python
carrot.random_letters_generator()
```
And if you want to use ``carrot.both`` like a developer, here is the command:
 ```Python
carrot.both_numbers_letters_generator()
```
Use them knowing these commands can work not as they used to. Happy coding!
