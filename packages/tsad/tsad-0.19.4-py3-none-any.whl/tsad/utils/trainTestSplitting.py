    """
    A function that splits the time series into train and test sequence subsets.   

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        Array of shape (n_samples, n_features) with pd.timestamp index.

    len_seq : int
        Length of the sequence, which is used to predict the next point/points.
    
    points_ahead : int, default=0
        How many points ahead we predict, reflected in y
         
    gap :  int, default=0
        The gap between last point of sequence, which we used as input 
        for prediction and first point of potential model output sequence
        (prediction).If the last point of input sequence is t, then the 
        first point of the output sequence is t + gap +1. The parameter 
        is designed to be able to predict sequence after a additional time 
        interval.
    
    step :  int, default=1.
        Sample generation step. If the first point was t for 
        the 1st sample (sequence) of the train, then for the 2nd sample 
        (sequence) of the train it will be t + step if intersection=True,
        otherwise the same but without intersections of the series values.

    intersection :  bool, default=True
        The presence of one point in time in different samples (sequences) 
        for the train set and and separately for the test test. 
        If True, the train and the test never have common time points.
    
    test_size : float or int or timestamp for df, or list of timestamps, default=0.25.
        The size of the test set. 
          - If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
            of the dataset to include in the test split. 
          - If int, represents the absolute number of test samples. If None, the value is set to the
            complement of the train size. 
          - If 0, then it will return the X,y values in X_train, y_train. 
          - If timestamp, for X_test we will use set from df[t:] 
          - If list of timestamps [t1,t2], for X_test we will use set from df[t1:t2] 
          - If ``train_size`` is None, it will be set to 0.25. *

        
    train_size : float or int, default=None.
        The size of the train set.
          - If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
            proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. 
          - If int, represents the absolute number of train samples. 
          - If 0, then it will return the X,y values in X_test, y_test.  
          - If timestamp for df, for X_train we will use set for train from df[:t]  
          - If list of timestamps [t1,t2], for X_train we will use set for train from df[t1:t2]  
          - If None,the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.
        
    what_to_shuffle: {'nothing', 'all','train'}, str. Default = 'train'. 
          - If 'train' we random shuffle only X_train, and y_train. 
            Test samples are unused for the shuffle. Any sample from X_test is later
            than any sample from X_train. This is also true for respectively
          - If 'all' in analogy with sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split
          - If 'nothing' shuffle is not performed.
        
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the split.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.*  

    Returns
    -------
    (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test) : tuple 
        Tuple containing train-test split of inputs
