# whether/how to prefetch all records/observations for entities
prefetch:

  # enable/disable prefetch for command
  #
  # If prefetch is enabled, Kestrel will send additional queries to the data
  # source to search for related records regarding entities retrieved from the
  # user-specified pattern, collecting more complete information (attributes,
  # connections to other entities) of the entities from different records.
  switch_per_command:
    get: true
    find: true

  # declare the list of entity types to not prefetch
  #
  # This can be used when a user finds prefetch hinders the performance with
  # large amount of results for one or more generic type of entities. For
  # example, the data source may have millions of records containing
  # `C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll` touched by all Windows processes in a short
  # amount of time. Executing a Kestrel command `f = FIND file LINKED p` will
  # retrieve the file from a process and then start prefetch to gain
  # information/connections of the file from all processes. Retrieval of
  # millions records will likely result in a performance issue, thus the user
  # can put `file` in this list to disable prefetch for it.
  excluded_entities:
    # By default, Kestrel disables prefetch for the 3 entities, which are
    # shared by large amount of logs
    - file

  # Detailed logic to identify the same process from different records is more
  # complex than many data source query language can express, so Kestrel
  # retrieves potential same process candidate records and perform fine-grained
  # process identification in Kestrel with these parameters.
