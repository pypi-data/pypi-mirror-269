# Limit Image Quality

```
.-.   .-..---.
| |__ | || O ,
`----'`-'`-'\\
```

Limit the quality of images in your repo via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

## Disclaimer

**This tool does not make backups of files it changes.**

This tool uses ImageMagick's quality detection. This method is not flawless and based on internal metrics that may change.
This is why the recommended way to use this tool is via a Docker image with a fixed tag.
It's less likely the same image will get different results if the underlying ImageMagick version does not change.

## Usage

It's recommend to use pre-commit directly via the pre-build docker image we release.

### Parameters

Run `liq --help` to get an up-to-date list.
Defaults are **not** considered part of a stable and may change version to version.

```
Usage: liq [OPTIONS] PATHS...

  .-.   .-..---.  Qteal
  | |__ | || O ,  fixing systems, not people
  `----'`-'`-'\\  v0.1

  Limit the quality of JPG images.
  When running with --fix it will overwrite the file(s) in question.
  No backups are made. This is a potentially destructive operation!
  Exits with 1 if any files where/would have been changed.

Options:
  --version                    Show the version and exit.
  -q, --quality INTEGER RANGE  [default: 75; 0<=x<=100]
  --fix / --no-fix             [default: no-fix]
  -v, --verbose                log the detected quality of every image
  --help                       Show this message and exit.
```

### pre-commit

The intended use is via the provided hook in the repo, using the docker hook:

```yaml
repos:
  # This repo <3
  - repo: https://gitlab.com/Qteal/oss/liq
    rev: main
    hooks:
      - id: limit-image-quality-docker
        args: [-q75, --fix]
```

Then run `pre-commit autoupdate` to transform the main rev into the latest release.

There is also a hook that does not use docker (`limit-image-quality`), for which you have to install ImageMagick yourself according to [Wand's documentation](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/latest/guide/install.html).
This hook is usually quicker, but is more likely to result in version differences as it relies on system software.

### Docker image

It's also possible to use the docker image directly.
The image is published to `registry.gitlab.com/qteal/oss/liq/liq`.

Every release gets a tag, `latest` is always up-to-date with the latest release.
You can also use branch name tags, so `main` is good for those living on the bleeding edge.

### Pip

The Python package is also push to the package registry of this repo (for all builds on main) and pypi (for releases).

Install via pip as `pip install liq`.

Run `liq --help` for more info.

You must install the required system dependencies of [Wand](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/latest/guide/install.html) yourself.

## Local Development

Only supported on Linux or something Linux like enough that I won't notice when you make a merge request.

If you want to work on this project, you need to have ImageMagic installed including the development libraries and headers.
It's recommended to follow the installation instructions in [Wand's documentation](https://docs.wand-py.org/en/latest/guide/install.html).

Use [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) to set up the project environment.
