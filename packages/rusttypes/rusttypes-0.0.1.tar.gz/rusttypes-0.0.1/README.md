## Why?

>   Bring the power of Rust to Python! Kind of...

``rusttypes`` is a Python 3 library that provides a set of utilities to write
Python code that is more Rust-like. This includes:

- A ``Result`` type that can be used to return either a value or an error.
- A ``Option`` type that can be used to return either a value or nothing.

It implements all the basic operations that you would expect from these types,
such as ``map``, ``and_then``, ``or_else``, etc.. At least as far as Python
allows it, and I was able to implement it. (:

## Getting Started

Install using `pip`:

```
pip install rusttypes
```

Install using `poetry` CLI:

```
poetry add rusttypes
```

or using `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
rusttypes = "^0.0.1"
```
