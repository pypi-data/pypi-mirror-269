# PowerSchool API Python Package

This Python package provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the PowerSchool API, allowing users to perform various operations such as retrieving student counts, student details, course counts, and more from a PowerSchool server.

## Features

- Get student count for a specified school.
- Retrieve detailed student information.

## Installation

To install the PowerSchool API package, use pip:

```bash
pip install powerschoolapi-cars1n
```

## Usage

Here's a quick start on how to use the PowerSchool API package:

```bash
from powerschoolapi_cars1n import PS

# Initialize the PowerSchool API client
ps = PS()

# Get the count of students in a school
student_count = ps.get_student_count("school_dcid")
print("Student Count:", student_count)

# Get detailed information about a student
student_info = ps.get_student("student_dcid")
print("Student Information:", student_info)

```

## Configuration

Before using the PowerSchool API, ensure that you have set up the necessary environment variables. Your .env file should look something like this.

```bash
CLIENT_ID =

### Semi-working features
If you have a powerschool plugin then the normal queries_root folder that is required can be taken into account when making calls to those user created endpoints.

Here is how you would set it up.

```bash
    from AccessToken import AccessToken
    import os
# Create an AccessToken instance and get the access token
    token_instance = AccessToken()
    access_token = token_instance.get_access_token()

    queries_root_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "queries_root")

    data_access = DataAccess(access_token, school_dcid="1234", base_url=base_url, queries_root_path=queries_root_path, xml_file_name="the file name that is in your queries root folder")
# User created path com.organization.attendance_manager.attendance.get_schwifty
    response = data_access.fetch_data("attendance.get_schwifty", params={
                "date": "01/01/1999",
                "schoolid": "1234",
            }, method="POST")

    ic(response)
```
