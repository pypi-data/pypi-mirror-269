    Abstract Base Class (ABC) for Classifier objects (i.e. models that can detect image targets).
    ABC cannot be instantiated, and must be subclassed with abstract methods implemented before use.

    - `classifier` (Callable): image classifier model
    
    ### Methods
    #### Abstract
    - `detect`: detect image targets
