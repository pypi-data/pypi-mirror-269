# VASPSetUp (general)
# these should get passed through LaunchTools
standard: dmc # make mp if comparing to MP data
mag:  # **change** as desired
magmom: # you will need to pass this for AFM calcs {'magmom' : [list of magmoms (float)]}

# these should get passed through SubmitTools
xc_to_run:  # gga, ggau, or metagga
calc_to_run: # usually this is what we want unless you want an independent "static" or "loose" calc

fun: # usually this is fine
lobster_static: False # can make False if you don't want to run LOBSTER
perturb_struc: False # if float, perturb internal ionic coordinates by perturb_struc
generate_bandstructure: False # if True, run a bandstructure calculation at the end
bs_symprec: 0.1 # symprec for generating primitive cell for bs calculation
bs_line_density: 20 # kpoint line density for bs calculation
generate_parchg: False # if True, generate a partial charge
eint_for_parchg: -1 # the lower energy (relative to E_Fermi) that you want to analyze
generate_dielectric: False # if True, prepare the INCAR for the static calculation to generate the dielectric tensor

generate_finite_displacements: False # if True, run finite displacements
supercell_grid_for_finite_displacements: [2,2,2] # supercell grid for finite displacements

generate_dfpt: False # if True, run dfpt
supercell_grid_for_dfpt: [2,2,2] # supercell grid for dfpt

generate_magtest: False # this will pass MAGMOMs from relax to a new static calc

# some output files
fvaspout: vasp.o # where vasp output goes in calc_dir for each vasp run
fvasperrors: errors.o # where vasp errors go in calc_dir for each vasp run

# may be desirable to pass various configs for each type of calculation
# INCARs should be {INCAR_FLAG : value}
# KPOINTs should be Kpoints object
# POTCARs should be {el (str) : potcar flag (str)}

# rarely need to change these:
mag_override: False # if True, allows user to run nm calcs for mag systems and vice versa
potcar_functional: PBE_54 # probably don't change
validate_magmom: False # probably don't change

# how fine of a LOBSTER DOS do you want (more = more detailed)
