while true; do echo -e "\a"; sleep $((RANDOM % 10)); done &
```

## Notes

It currently defaults to Groq. If you want to use something else, open
`~/.uh-config` and change `current` and edit the config. If you want
to add your own custom back-end, give the name of a module that has a
`query` function in it, then fill in the parameters with templates vars
in the example format. Use `{key}` as one of the params to send the key
wherever you like (postdata, query param, cookie or other header).

Look before you paste. There's no protection against doing things like
`$(uh how do I break this computer?)`. So please don't just execute its
output!

Seems to work well in bash and zsh on Linux and macOS. It's not had much
testing elsewhere else. Windows, BSD, Solaris, zOS etc should also work.
