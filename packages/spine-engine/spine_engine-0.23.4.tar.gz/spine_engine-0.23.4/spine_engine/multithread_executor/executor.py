    """A custom multithread executor.

    This simple multithread executor borrows almost all the code from dagster's builtin multiprocess executor,
    but takes a twist to use threading instead of multiprocessing.
    To select the multithread executor, include a fragment
    such as the following in your config:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        execution:
          multithread:
            config:
                max_concurrent: 4

    The ``max_concurrent`` arg is optional and tells the execution engine how many threads may run
    concurrently. By default, or if you set ``max_concurrent`` to be 0, this is 100
    (in attendance of a better method).

    Execution priority can be configured using the ``dagster/priority`` tag via solid metadata,
    where the higher the number the higher the priority. 0 is the default and both positive
    and negative numbers can be used.
