The project adopted the ``autopep8`` tool to assist with
automatic code formatting. It is chosen over ``black``
because it is less intrusive which is important to the
maintainer as it promotes inclusivity.
``autopep8`` is integrated into the ``pre-commit`` check
runner and is configured to only correct :pep:`8`
violations, avoiding changes to compliant snippets.
