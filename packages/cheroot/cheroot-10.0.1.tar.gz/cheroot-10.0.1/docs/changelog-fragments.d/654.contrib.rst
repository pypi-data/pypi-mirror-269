The changelog management is now implemented through
the :std:doc:`Towncrier <towncrier:index>` tool
-- by :user:`webknjaz`.

The contributors are now expected to :std:ref:`include
change log fragment files in their pull requests
<adding change notes with your prs>`.

These news snippets can link one or more issues or pull
requests, and be of one or more of the following categories:

* ``bugfix``: A bug fix for something we deemed an improper undesired
  behavior that got corrected in the release to match pre-agreed
  expectations.
* ``feature``: A new behavior, public APIs. That sort of stuff.
* ``deprecation``: A declaration of future API removals and breaking
  changes in behavior.
* ``breaking``: When something public gets removed in a breaking way.
  Could be deprecated in an earlier release.
* ``doc``: Notable updates to the documentation structure or build
  process.
* ``packaging``: Notes for downstreams about unobvious side effects
  and tooling. Changes in the test invocation considerations and
  runtime assumptions.
* ``contrib``: Stuff that affects the contributor experience. e.g.
  Running tests, building the docs, setting up the development
  environment.
* ``misc``: Changes that are hard to assign to any of the above
  categories.
