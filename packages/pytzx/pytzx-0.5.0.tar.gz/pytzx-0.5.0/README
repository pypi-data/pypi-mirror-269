Pytzx
=====

Pytzx is a simple API for creating TZX files in Python. TZX is a file format
that represents a virtual tape or cassette. Cassette tapes were a common method
of loading software on micro-computers throughout the 80s and very early 90s.
TZX files are primarily useful with emulators to provide an accurate simulation
of the loading process. Although TZX files are heavily biased towards the
Sinclair ZX Spectrum machines, they can indeed be used with almost any platform
of that era.


Usage
=====

tzx.py - Provides TZX specific classes
zxfile.py - Provides classes which aid in creating spectrum files that can be
used in conjunction with tzx.py.

Please see the supplied examples for basic information on how to use Pytzx.
Documention on the API can also be accessed by changing to the directory where
tzx.py and zxfile.py are installed and running python. At the python prompt
type:

import tzx
import zxfile
help(tzx)
help(zxfile)

examples/01-standard-loader:
Creates a spectrum loading screen of the python logo.

examples/02-turbo-loader:
Creates a turbo-loaded loading screen of the python logo.

When creating TZX files, it may be useful to consult the TZX file specification:
