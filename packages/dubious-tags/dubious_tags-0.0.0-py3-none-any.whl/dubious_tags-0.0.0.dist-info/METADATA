# Dubious tags

Detects and lists dubious OSM tags - with explanation why they are suspicious.

This is intended to cover rather rarely used tags.

It definitely should not include tags where it is disputed or discussed are they good idea or not.

# Warning

Do not change or edits this tags blindly! This tags are listed here rather than [proposed for bot edit](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mechanical_Edits/Mateusz_Konieczny_-_bot_account#Active_tasks) as it is not safe to change them without verification or local knowledge.

Not editing is better than editing and breaking things.

Though in some cases you may have local knowledge or better understanding. In such case follow [OSM rules](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct) if you want to retag objects without individual review.
