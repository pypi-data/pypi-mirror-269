   conda install R
   R
   ```

   ```r
   > install.packages("devtools")
   > devtools::install_github("tanlabcode/CytoTalk")
   ```
3. Install Driver2Comm
   install Driver2Comm using pip
   ``` bash
      pip install Driver2Comm -U
   ```

## Tutorial

### Preparation

If you use CytoTalk as your MCTC network construction algorthm, the input data folder should be agreed with following structure.

```txt
── Cytotalk_output
   ├─ patient1
   		├─ Celltype1-Celltype2
   			├─ FinalNetwork.txt
       	├─ Celltype1-Celltype3
       		├─ FinalNetwork.txt
       	└─ Celltype2-Celltype3
       		├─ FinalNetwork.txt
   ├─ patient2
   		├─ Celltype1-Celltype2
   			├─ FinalNetwork.txt
       	├─ Celltype1-Celltype3
       		├─ FinalNetwork.txt
       	└─ Celltype2-Celltype3
       		├─ FinalNetwork.txt
   ├─ patient3
   		├─ ...
   └─ patient4
   		├─ ...
   		
```

```python
from Driver2Comm import formulate_c2c_network
formulate_c2c_network(inputPATH,outputPATH)
```


Then in your output directory, you will find a `c2c_network.data` , and the  `c2c_network.data` is in following format.

Driver2Comm can extend to other CCC inferences method, in this case, you can also directly formulate you cell-cell communication as the following format.

```txt
t # 1 			# t # 1 means the MCTC network of patient 1
v 0 FERMT3__Macrophages # vertex data was formualed as 'v vertex_id vertex_label'
v 1 MITF__Macrophages
e 0 1 0					# edge was formualed as 'e vertex_id_a vertex_id_b edge label'
...
t # n
v 1 SOCS1__Cd8+Tcells
v 1 CD52__Cd8+Tcells
e 0 1 0
t # -1			# t # -1 represent as the end of this file
```

Driver2Comm also need patient driver information as input

|      | Patient_id | Driver |
| ---- | ---------- | ------ |
| 0    |       patient1     |    ESR1    |
| 1    |       patient2       |   ESR1     |
| 2    |       patient3       |   ERBB2     |
| 3    |       patient4      |    ERBB2    |


### Usage

You can apply Driver2Comm in the following step.

- Step0: Construction of cell-cell communication network
- Step1: Identification of cancer-driver assoication communicaiton patterns
- Step2: Downstream analysis of Driver2Com

#### Step0: construction of cell-cell communication network

```bash
Rscript construction_ccc_network.R
```

#### Step1: Identification of cancer-driver assoicatied communicaiton patterns

After construction of CCC network by Cytotalk, we started to identify the cancer-driver associated communicaiton patterns. 
The rest analysis of Driver2Comm is fully based on python implement. Based on the excellent flexibility and interactivity of jupyter notebook, we recommend you to use notebook for all of Driver2Comm's remaining analyses.

```python
import Driver2Comm as dc
c2c_network = 
d2c_instance = Driver2Comm(
					minsup = ,
					num_celltype=3,
					mode = 'driver',
					outputPATH ='./result',
                 	subtype_annotation = ,
                 	visualize = False,
                 	cancer_type = 'Lung'
    """
    parameters:
    __________________

        :param minsup: Hyperparameter, the minimal suppport of gSpan algorithm
        :param inputPATH: the input file path of Cytotalk input
        :param patient_metadata: the metadata of patients, must contain: driver gene of each patient
        :param num_celltype: the number of cell type in Multi-Cell-Type-Communication MCTC networks
        :param mode: cancer subtype or driver
        :param outputPATH: the output file path
        :param subtype_annotation: the subtype_annotation file path
        :param visualize: if user visualize the cancer driver associated CCC signature or not
        :param cancer_type: type of cancer

)
# run Driver2Comm to identify cancer driver associated CCC signatures.
d2c_instance.run()
```

#### Step2: Downstream analysis of Driver2Comm

We offer several ways to visualize and evaluate the cancer driver associated CCC signatures identified by Driver2Comm.

```python
d2c_instance.display_associated_FP()
# display all cancer driver associated CCC signatures on screen.

```
