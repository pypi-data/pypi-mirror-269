# NEET - Nanopore Error pattern Exploration Toolkit

The Nanopore Error pattern Exploration Toolkit (`NEET`) provides a range of functionalities that provide an easily accessible and interactive analysis approach for (systematic) base-calling errors in direct RNA nanopore sequencing data. The implemented modules include options for condensing, visualizing and differentiating error features contained in direct RNA sequencing data - including mismatch, deletion and insertion rates, among others.

## Installation

It is recommended to use Conda/Mamba and pip for installation:

```
conda create -y -n neet python==3.10 && conda activate neet
pip install neet-nanopore
neet --version
```

For more information and alternative installation approaches refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/dietvin/neet/wiki/01-Installation).

## General usage

Once installed `NEET` can be accessed via the terminal:

```
neet --help
```

Individual modules can be accessed as follows:

```
neet [MODULE] --help
```

Available modules are:

- Pileup Extractor (`extractor`): Extract data from pileup files into feature tables
- Summary (`summmary`): Summarize and visualize feature tables
- Position-of-Interest Summary (`poisummary`): Summarize and visualize specific positions of interest
- Position-of-Interest View (`poiview`): Visualize positions of interest
- Position-of-Interest  (`poicompare`): Statistically compare positions of interest
- Two-Sample Extractor (`extractdiff`): Identify and extract positions of increased error rates between two conditions
- Filter (`filter`): Filter feature tables by given features
- Bedops (`bedops`): Process and manipulate bed files
  The modules are interconnected to provide different workflows for different scenarios. An overview of the main workflows is given below:

A detailled description of all available modules is provided in the [Wiki](https://github.com/dietvin/neet/wiki/02-Modules). The Wiki also provides [walkthroughs](https://github.com/dietvin/neet/wiki/03-Example-Workflows) for some possible use cases.
