Please note this repository uses black for formatting, ruff for linting and mypy for type checking.

Pre-commit hooks help to make committing easier by automating running black and ruff so if you want to 
make use of them, you can install them by using the following commands:

```shell
brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
