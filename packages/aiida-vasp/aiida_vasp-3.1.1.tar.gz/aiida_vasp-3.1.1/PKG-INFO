This is a plugin to `AiiDA`_ to run calculations with the ab-initio program `VASP`_.

Please have a look at the `AiiDA-VASP documentation`_ for instructions on how to install and use the plugin.

Installing the plugin
---------------------

..
  Keep this comment as it is used for including these steps in the install section of the docs.
  It includes everything past the next line.
  Start installation description

#. If you are already using `AiiDA`_, simply activate the virtual environment associated with it, here assumed to be located in ``~/env/aiida-vasp``::

   $ source ~/env/aiida-vasp/bin/activate

#. Otherwise, set up a new virtual environment::

   $ python -m venv ~/env/aiida-vasp

#. And then enable the newly installed virtual environment::

   $ source ~/env/aiida-vasp/bin/activate

#. Install the `AiiDA-VASP`_ plugin (and `AiiDA`_ if that is not already installed)::

   $ (aiida-vasp) pip install aiida-vasp

  If you need to install the compatibility release of `AiiDA-VASP`_ which works with `AiiDA`_ 1.6.4 you should instead install the plugin
  using ``pip install aiida-vasp=2.2``, but this is not recommended and only mentioned for legacy support. For the legacy version you
  also most likely have to run ``reentry scan -r aiida`` after installing the plugin.

This will automatically install the `AiiDA`_ python package(s) as well as any other dependencies of the plugin and register all the plugin classes with `AiiDA`_.

Please consider that `AiiDA`_ have prerequisite that needs to be installed and ensured working. The steps above will not take care of this for you. Please consult `AiiDA prerequisites`_ and follow the instructions therein.
