JWST NIRSpec Observation Visualization Tool (NOVT)
==================================================

The NIRSpec Observation Visualization Tool (NOVT) visualizes projected footprints
for the NIRSpec and NIRCam instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
It is intended to aid in planning NIRCam pre-imaging for NIRSpec MOS observations,
by allowing simultaneous display and configuration of the NIRSpec and NIRCam
fields of view for a given sky position.
