When generating questions and answers, adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Your ground truth answers must be directly derived from the content within the provided text. Do not make up, hallucinate, or generate answers that are not explicitly supported by the given text.
2. Ensure that the questions you generate are relevant to the financial context and can be answered based on the information provided in the text.
3. Include the relevant 'context' paragraph from which you generated each question and ground truth answer pair. The 'context' paragraph MUST contain the specific information that supports the ground truth answer.
4. If the provided text does not contain sufficient information to generate a question-answer pair, do not attempt to create one.
5. Your responses should be in the following format:
   Question: [Generated question]
   Answer: [Ground truth answer]
   Context: [Relevant paragraph from the text that supports the answer]
