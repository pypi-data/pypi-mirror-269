# Echoai Transformer Block Package

This package provides components for building Transformer blocks, including Multi-Head Attention and FeedForward layers.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install echoai-transformer-block


import torch
from echoai_transformer_block import Block

# Define parameters
n_heads = 8
n_embed = 512
block_size = 16
dropout = 0.1
expand = 4

# Create a Block instance
block = Block(n_heads, n_embed, block_size, dropout, expand)

# Example input tensor
input_tensor = torch.randn(1, 16, 512)

# Forward pass through the Block
output_tensor = block(input_tensor)

print("Output shape:", output_tensor.shape)


from echoai_transformer_block import Block
from echoai_transformer_block import MultiAttentionHead
from echoai_transformer_block import FeedForward
