Topology
======================================


Graph theory and node classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With nodes it is possible to analise a fracture network in a more abstract way by defining connections and relations
between fracture segments. In a fracture network, fractures are connected in different ways (and sometimes
even isolated) and by focussing on the topological relationships between objects  it is possible to extrapolate interesting
descriptive features. A complex fracture network can be simplified by defining a Graph (G) composed of Edges (E) and Vertices (V)
such that for each edge there are **two** vertices. This means that the **degree** at each node
(i.e. how many edges are connected to a node) can be used to classify them accordingly.

   Higher abstraction is possible in which the spatial dimension is completely disregarded.

Node classes
+++++++++++++

Four classes of nodes have been defined:

+ I nodes: Given by a termination of a fracture in the outcrop
+ Y or T nodes: Given by a termination of a fracture on **another fracture**
+ X nodes: Given by crossing fractures
+ U nodes: Given by a termination of a fracture on a **boundary**

Geologically each node type can give information on the nature of the fracture and the genetic processes of the network.
I and U nodes define the "completeness" of the given fracture.
An isolated fracture (i.e. bounded by two I vertices) is whole and so its length is complete
while the presence of U nodes will identify a cut fracture with a partial length.

Y and X nodes are useful on the other hand to define the relative chronology. For example in joints, Y nodes identify
abutting relationships (i.e. older cutting younger). X nodes on the other hand indicate cross-cutting relationships.

I Y and X nodes are also useful to describe the connectivity of the network; connected networks will have a higher
proportions of Y and X nodes while the opposite will be defined by a dominance of I nodes. Using this principles,
networks can be graphically represented in a ternary plot such as the one below.

   contour lines are the average number of connections per fracture derived from equation **A6** in Manzocchi (2002).
