    whether the maximum score is a positive or negative outcome.

def score_descriptives(values, counts):
    '''
    This function uses site-level data. Using the mean and count from each
    group, it calculates the weighted mean and weighted standard deviation
    of scores across the groups. It returns this, alongside a count of the
    pupils and groups included.

    Additional information about weighted standard deviation:
    This normalises weights so they sum 1 (and so they can't all be 0).
    It returns the biased variance and is like a weighted version of np.std().
    For small samples, may want to alter to unbiased variance.
