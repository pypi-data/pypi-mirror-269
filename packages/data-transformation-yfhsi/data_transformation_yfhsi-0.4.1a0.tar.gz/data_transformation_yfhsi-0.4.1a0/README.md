The Data Transformation Libraries package contains three modules:
transpose
time_series_windowing
cross_correlation

The transpose module includes the "transpose2d" function, which switches the axes of a 2D tensor.
The time_series_windowing module includes the "window1d" function for time series windowing.
The cross_correlation module includes the "convolution2d" function for cross-correlation.
