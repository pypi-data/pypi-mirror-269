.. note:: Changes are not immediately saved to the database(s). They need to be committed separately.

To commit your changes, select **Session -> Commit** from the hamburger menu, enter a commit message and press **Commit**.
Any changes made in the current session will be saved into the database.

To undo *all* changes since the last commit, select **Session -> Rollback** from the hamburger menu.

.. tip:: To undo/redo individual changes, use the **Edit -> Undo** and **Edit -> Redo** actions from the hamburger menu.
