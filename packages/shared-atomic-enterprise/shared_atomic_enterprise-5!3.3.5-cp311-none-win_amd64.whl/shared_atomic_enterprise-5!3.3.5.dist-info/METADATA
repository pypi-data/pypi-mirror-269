    If you are a root user, it is ok, then only root can run this package.
    If you are not root user, in the activation process you will need assistance from the root user.

    cd (the directory where the package is installed )
    chown root shared_atomic/atomic_python_suid
    chmod u+s shared_atomic/atomic_python_suid

    then the user who installed the package can run the package.
