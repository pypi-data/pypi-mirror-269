# NeuroScribe v0.1.0

NeuroScribe a lightweight deep learning framework.

## Installation

```
pip install neuro-scribe
```

**Notes:**

- If you want CUDA support for GPU acceleration, please ensure that you have CUDA Toolkit version 12 or higher installed on your device.<br> You can download CUDA Toolkit from the official NVIDIA website: [CUDA Toolkit Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- If you're installing NeuroScribe on an Apple Silicon Mac, NeuroScribe will automatically detect the architecture and install additional dependencies for Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) support.

## Available Accelerators

Neuroscribe currently supports the following accelerators:

- CPU (default)
- CUDA
- MPS (Metal Performance Shaders)

We plan to add support for additional accelerators to further enhance performance capabilities.
