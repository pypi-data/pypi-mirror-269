# Plover Sound

Very early in development, but it's coming along nicely! Let me know in the plover discord if you have any suggestions: **@ricecakes808**

## Installation

There are 3 modes you can use, `sample`, `mapped`, and `melody`. The "Sound" tool tab is added to your Plover window. Please open that to configure `plover_sound`.

You have to git clone and then install manually from the command line. See the instructions [here](https://plover.wiki/index.php/Plugins).
