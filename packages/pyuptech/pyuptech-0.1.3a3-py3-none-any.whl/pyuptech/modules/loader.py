    Load a dynamic library from the given file path and return a ctypes.CDLL object.

    Args:
        lib_file_path (str): The file path of the dynamic library to load.

    Returns: ctypes.CDLL | None: A ctypes.CDLL object representing the loaded library, or None if the library could
    not be loaded.

    Raises:
        Exception: If there is an error loading the library.

    Note: This function uses the lru_cache decorator to cache the loaded libraries, so subsequent calls with the same
    file path will return the cached library object.
