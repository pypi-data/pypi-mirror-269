The package allows to display an **interactive map with a choropleth
displaying some statistics as color per hectare** (100x100 meter square).

![Example map](https://github.com/mlisovyi/map_with_stats/raw/main/docs/figs/map_screenshot.jpeg)

!!! question "What is the use-case?"

      The typical use-case would be to visualise and do plausibility checks of hectare-level data
      as well as to compare statistics between geographic areas.

The package is created and tested to work for the **Switzerland coordinates**,
however, one could try to use it for any other map with hectare statistics.
