    Fallback loading of arguments (from V1 style) is now removed.
upgrade:
  - |
    The old way of returning the arguments, to load the arguments using the old
    ``get_*_args`` functions is now removed. If you were still relying on them
    (check the logs) you must migrate to using the argument parser as soon as
    possible.
