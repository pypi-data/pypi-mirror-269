        Obtain the linearized A, B matrices for the continuous differentiation function.
    Args:
        fun (function): the continuous ode differential function with input x and u
        x_dim, u_dim (vector)(dim, 1): expand set-point.
        ts (float): sampling period of the discrete model
        M (int): RK4 in one sample time ts, do rk4 (h = ts/M) times, to achieve accurate results, M should be larger
    Notes: 
        if the fun is discrete ode already, then will give the A, B for the linearized discrete model
