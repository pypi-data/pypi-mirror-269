## Disclaimer

<p align="center">
ðŸš¨ **Ready for daily use but still changing.** ðŸš¨
</p>

This means that we are still adding a lot of new features and sometimes we make
changes to the ones we already have while we try to improve the software based
on users' experience, test new ideas, make better design decisions, etc. Some of
these changes could be **backwards incompatible**. Keep that in mind before you
update PolarToolkit to a new major version (i.e. from `v1.0.0` to `v2.0.0`).

I welcome any feedback, ideas, or contributions! Please contact us on the
[GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/mdtanker/polartoolkit/discussions)
or submit an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mdtanker/polartoolkit/issues)
for problems or feature ideas.

<!-- SPHINX-START2 -->

The **PolarToolkit** python package provides some basic tools to help in
conducting polar research. You can use it to download common datasets (i.e.
BedMachine, Bedmap2, MODIA MoA), create maps and plots specific to Antarctica
(soon Greenland and the Arctic as well), and visualize data with multiple
methods.

Feel free to use, share, modify, and
[contribute](https://polartoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html) to
this project. I've mostly made this for personal usage so expect significant
changes. Hopefully, I'll implement more tests and Gallery examples soon.

## Project goals

Below is a list of some features I hope to eventually include. Feel free to make
a feature request through
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mdtanker/polartoolkit/issues/new/choose).

- Create 3D interactive models to help visualize data.
- Include more datasets to aid in downloading and storage.
- Additional projections and possible support for the Arctic region as well.
