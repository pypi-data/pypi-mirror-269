    """
    Estimate feature importances on a supervised task, given X and y.

    Classification tasks are assessed with logistic regression, a random
    forest, and KNN permutation importance. Regression tasks are assessed with
    lasso regression, a random forest, and KNN permutation importance.

    The scores from these assessments are normalized, and the normalized
    sum is returned.

    See the Tutorial in the documentation for more information.

    Args:
        X (array): an array representing the data.
        y (array or None): an array representing the target. If None, the task
            is assumed to be an unsupervised clustering task.
        task (str or None): either 'classification' or 'regression'. If None,
            the task will be inferred from the labels and a warning will show
            the assumption being made.
        random_state (int or None): the random state to use.

    Returns:
        array: The importance of the features, in the order in which they
            appear in X.

    Examples:
        >>> X = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0], [0, 3, 1], [0, 4, 0], [0, 5, 1], [0, 7, 0], [0, 8, 1], [0, 8, 0]]
