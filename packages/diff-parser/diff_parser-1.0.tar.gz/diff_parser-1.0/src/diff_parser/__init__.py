"""
This module provides classes for parsing and representing diff files.

Classes:
- Diff: Represents a diff file containing multiple blocks of changes.
- DiffBlock: Represents a single block of changes in a diff file.

Usage:
The Diff class can be used to parse a diff file and access its individual blocks.
Each DiffBlock represents a single block of changes in the diff file, containing information about the modified file, the type of modification, and the source and target hashes.

Example:
    diff = Diff("path/to/diff/file.diff")
    for block in diff:
        print(block.filname)    # main.py
        print(block.filepath)   # /path/to/main.py
        print(block.source_hash)# abcdef
        print(block.target_hash)# uvwxyz
        print(block.type)       # modified
        print(block.content)    # None (to be implemented)
