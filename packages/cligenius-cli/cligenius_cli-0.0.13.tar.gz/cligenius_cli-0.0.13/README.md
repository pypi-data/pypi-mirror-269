# Cligenius CLI

‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Use [Cligenius](https://github.com/khulnasoft/cligenius) instead of [Cligenius CLI](https://github.com/khulnasoft/cligenius-cli).

---

All the functionality in this repo for [`cligenius-cli`](https://github.com/khulnasoft/cligenius-cli), has been integrated into [Cligenius](https://github.com/khulnasoft/cligenius) since version 0.12.1.

The main repo, https://github.com/khulnasoft/cligenius, publishes a PyPI package `cligenius-cli` (that used to be this repo), and that PyPI package does nothing other than depend on `cligenius`.

All the functionality has been integrated into `cligenius`.

Install instead `cligenius`:

```bash
pip install cligenius
```

That includes the `cligenius` command.

This repo is now deprecated and archived. ü§ì
