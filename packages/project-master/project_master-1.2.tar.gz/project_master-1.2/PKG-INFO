## Introduction

The Project Structure Generator is a handy tool for Python developers to quickly set up the directory structure for their projects. It automates the creation of common directories and files, saving time and ensuring consistency across projects.

---

## Features

- Supports two modes: standard mode and pro mode.
- Standard mode creates basic project structure with essential folders and files.
- Pro mode includes additional folders and files for more comprehensive projects.
- Customizable project name and directory structure.

---

## Usage

```bash
pip install project_master
```

Let's say you want to create a new project called "MyAwesomeProject" in pro mode. You would run the following command:


```python
from project_master import Cat

Cat.build_structure(project_name="MyAwesomeProject", developer_name="Hardy21", pro_mode=True)
```


- `project_name`: Name of the project (root directory name).
- `pro_mode`: (Optional) If set to `True`, creates a more comprehensive project structure. Default is `False`.


This will create the following directory structure:

```
MyAwesomeProject/
