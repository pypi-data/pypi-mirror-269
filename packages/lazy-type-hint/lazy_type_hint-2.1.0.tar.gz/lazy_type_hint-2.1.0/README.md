# LazyTypeHint

Type hint any Python (nested) data structure! Dictionaries, callables, Pandas DataFrames...

```
pip install lazy-type-hint
```

## Quick examples

```py
from lazy_type_hint import LazyTypeHint, LazyTypeHintLive

data = [1,2,3]
LazyTypeHint().from_data(data, class_name="MyClass").to_file("file.py")
LazyTypeHint().from_data(data, class_name="MyClass").to_string()
data_type_hinted = LazyTypeHintLive().from_data(data, class_name="MyClass")
```

## Main features

1. Get corresponding type hints from any given data structure and with mutltiple parsing
   options. Export it as a file or as a string.

   ```py
      from lazy_type_hint import LazyTypeHint, ParsingStrategies

      # INPUT
      people = [
          {
              "name": "Peter",
              "age": 40,
              "kids": (
                  {
                      "name": "Peter Jr",
                      "age": 10,
                  },
                  {
                      "name": "Peter Jr2",
                      "age": 8,
                  },
              ),
          },
          {
              "name": "Kevin",
              "age": 42,
              "job": "Carpenter",
              "kids": (
                  {
                      "name": "Peter Jr",
                      "age": 10,
                  },
              ),
          },
      ]

      people_type_hint = (
          LazyTypeHint(
              strategies=ParsingStrategies(
                  min_height_to_define_type_alias=2,
                  tuple_size_strategy="any size",
              )
          )
          .from_data(people, class_name="People")
          .to_string()
      )
      print(people_type_hint)
   ```

   ```py
    # OUTPUT
    from typing import List, Tuple, TypedDict
    from typing_extensions import NotRequired


    class PeopleDictKidsDict(TypedDict):
        name: str
        age: int


    class PeopleDict(TypedDict):
        name: str
        age: int
        kids: Tuple[PeopleDictKidsDict, ...]
        job: NotRequired[str]

    People = List[PeopleDict]
   ```
2. [EXPERIMENTAL] Get type hints live with `LazyTypeHintLive`. The API changes its local
   interface as soon as you use it, allowing to automatically infer and reuse your type
   hints after executing your program once.

    This will allow you to:

3. Easily type hint your files (YAML, JSON) and parse extra comments found within this
   file as part of the type hint docstrings. Given a yaml file like:

   ```yaml
    # Collection of sensors
    sensors:
      - name: Sensor1
        # Type of sensor used
        sensor_type: Temperature
        location: Living Room
        # Maximum amount allowed.
        # NOTE: Only 3 are available
        threshold: 25  # Units: [C]

      - name: Sensor2
        sensor_type: Humidity
        location: Bedroom
        threshold: 60

      - name: Sensor3
        sensor_type: Pressure
        location: Kitchen
        threshold: 1000
   ```

   And the code:
   ```py
      from lazy_type_hint import LazyTypeHint


    def load_yaml_file(file_path):
        with open(file_path, "r") as file:
            data = yaml.safe_load(file)
        return data


    print(LazyTypeHint().from_yaml_file(
        loader=load_yaml_file,
        path="example.yaml",
        class_name="Sensors",
        comments_are=("above", "side"),
    ).to_string())
   ```

   Generate type hints like:

   ```py
   from typing import List, TypedDict


   class SensorsSensorsDict(TypedDict):
       name: str
       sensor_type: str
       """Type of sensor used. NOTE: Only 3 are available."""
       location: str
       threshold: int
       """
       Maximum amount allowed.

       Units: [C].
       """

   SensorsSensors = List[SensorsSensorsDict]


   class Sensors(TypedDict):
       sensors: SensorsSensors
       """Collection of sensors."""
   ```

## What makes it a different tool?

There are some tools that aim to perform something similar. `Cattrs` or `pydantic` require
knowing the structure beforehand. Then, the developer is responsible for writing it. They
are validation-oriented. This tool is more geared towards providing better type hints in
an automated way and ensuring that the structure is accessed correctly. Although other
tools such as `Stubgen` are able to generate `.pyi` files in an automated way, it might be
required to edit the environment to indicate where these stub-based files are located.

## All features

Main features:
 - Type hint any (nested) structure.
 - Validate structures by comparising its string representation via `LazyTypeHintLive`
 - Dictionaries can be type hinted as `TypedDict`, meaning that the IDE will have extra
   information about its underlying structures. Developer can therefore benefit from extra
   static analysis or autcomplete features.
 - Similarity based merge:
   - Equal (nested) structures will be detected as such and type hinted under the same type alias.
   - Similar structures such as dictionaries will be merged indicating which keys were
     found to be not mandatory or required.
 - Type hint structures within any given file (YAML, JSON...).
 - Document structures:
    - Specify a specific keyword within dictionaries that will be parsed and
      included as a docstring.
    - Some file format such as like YAML will also find and parse comments as docstrings.
 - Wide range of type hint based on strategies. The user can select at any time: 
   - Which kind of container is prefered (`Sequence`/`list`)
   - How to type hint a tuple (either with fixed or non-fixed size)
   - The complexity of the type aliases to be created.
   - Dictionaries typed as `Mapping`, `Dict` or `TypedDict`
   - Minimum percentage of similarity between dicts to be merged.
   - Mutable or read-only based `TypedDict`.
 
Structures that can be type hinted:
 - Sequences: list, tuples
 - Sets: sets, frozensets
 - Dictionaries: dict, MappingProxyType
 - Pandas DataFrame: Full support for string-based columns and `MultiIndex` columns
 - Simple built-in types: bool, int, float, range, slice, None, str
 - Callables: lambdas, functions, staticmethods, classmethods, built-in functions
 - Module types
 - IOBase
 - Iterators
 - Custom objects: instances and classes
