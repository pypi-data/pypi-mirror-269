# animatebar
The animate_bar function generates an animated bar plot using Plotly, displaying changes in bar heights over time. It takes in data representing the initial and final heights of the bars, along with the duration of the animation. The function creates an interactive plot where users can see the bars gradually transition from their initial heights to their final heights, providing a visually appealing way to visualize changes in data over time.
