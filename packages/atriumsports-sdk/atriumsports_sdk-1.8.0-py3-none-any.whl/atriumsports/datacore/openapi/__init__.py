DataCore API  - Sport

# Introduction

The DataCore API is a REST based API. This means it makes use of the followng HTTP primitives:
 * GET - To retrieve data
 * POST - To add a record
 * PUT - To update a record
 * DELETE - To delete a record

All data sent and received as well as error messages is in the JSON format.

## Character Sets and Names

All data sent as both body and query parameters should be in the UTF-8 character set. All data returned will also be in UTF-8 strings.

A number of fields (especially names) have both a *local* and *latin* variant. The *local* variant is the string as it would be written in the local language of the organization.  The *latin* variant is the string as it would be written, only using latin characters/alphabet. Character sets like Cyrillic, Chinese are valid for the *local* string but not the *latin* string.  Regardless of the name, all strings should still be sent using UTF-8.

## Partial Responses

By default, the server sends back the full representation of a resource after processing requests. For better performance, you can ask the server to send only the fields you really need and get a partial response instead. This lets your application avoid transferring, parsing and storing un-needed data.

To request a partial response, use the `fields` query parameter to specify the fields you want returned.

    fields=dob,firstName,familyName,organization(id),organizations[name],teams[name,details/metrics/*,tags(id)]

### Syntax

 Character | Meaning
 --------- | -------
 **,**     | Delimits fields. All fields need to be delimited by a **,**.  eg. `fields=firstName,familyName`
 **/**     | Use `a/b` to select a field b that is nested within field a; use `a/b/c` to select a field c nested within b.
 **( )**   | The subselector allows you to specify a set of sub fields of an array or object by placing those fields in the parentheses. For example `competitors(name,address/state)` would return the name fields of the competitors key and the state field of the address key inside the competitors object.  This is also equivalent to `competitors/name,competitors/address/state`.
 **\***   | The wildcard character matches all fields at a level. eg. `*,organization/id` would return all fields, but only the id field of the organization key
 **[]**  | The field selection will generally only refer to the fields being returned in the *data* section on the response, but by giving the name of the resource type and then enclosing the field selection syntax in square brackets you can select which fields display in the *included* section as well. eg `firstName,familyName,organizations[name,id,country]` will display the firstName and familyName from the data element and only the name, id and country from the organizations resources in the include section.

All field references are relative to the `data` element.

If the resourceType and id fields are not displayed inside the data section for a sub-element, then the system will not make them available for [Resource Inclusion](#Resource_Inclusion), regardless of the use of the includes parameter.


## Pagination
When retrieving information using GET methods, the optional `limit` parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The maximum is 1000. If this value is empty `limit` defaults to 10.

If more rows are available, the response will include a `next` element (inside the *links* section), which contains a URL for requesting the next page. If this value is not provided, no more rows are available. A `previous` page element is also provided if appropriate.

These URIs can be generated manually by using the `offset` parameter combined with the `limit` parameter. The `offset` parameter will return `limit` rows of data starting at the **offset + 1** row.


## Sorting
Where allowed, a route can have `sortBy` passed with a list of fields to sort by.  For each allowed field a `-` before the field name will denote DESC sort. The default sort is ASCENDING.
The below example will sort by `startTimeUTC` "descending" then `fixtureNumber` "ascending":

?sortBy=-startTimeUTC,fixtureNumber

## Resource Inclusion
When a response is returned it will not automatically include extra data from other resources/models. It will only list the resource type and id. eg.

        "competition" : {
            "resourceType" : "competitions",
            "id" : "009e9276-5c80-11e8-9c2d-fa7ae01bbebc"
        },
If specified in the query string the `include` parameter will expand that resource in the *includes* section of the response. The `include` parameter takes a comma separated list of resourceTypes to be included.

    /v1/sport/org/1/teams/009e9276-5c80-11e8-9c2d-fa7ae01bbebc?include=competitions,leagues

If the resourceType is included in the parameter and that resourceType is available in the response, then response will include an *includes* key.  Inside that *includes* key is a *resources* object.  Inside that object, there are keys for each type of included resourceType.  Inside each resourceType keyed against the id is an object representing that resource.

    {
        "meta": ...
        "links": ...
        "data": ...
        "includes": {
            "resources": {
                "competitions":
                    "009e9276-5c80-11e8-9c2d-fa7ae01bbebc": {
                        ...
                        Competition Resource Details
                        ...        
                    }
                },
                "leagues": {
                    "009e9276-5c80-11e8-9c2d-fa7bc24e4ebc": {
                        ...
                        League Resource Details
                        ...        
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

If the resourceType/id block is not available in the response, then the `include` will not link in the requested resource.  eg. an `include=competitions` in a fixtures call will not return anything as the competition resource is not returned in these calls. However, the include functionality also checks the included resources for resourceType/id blocks. This means that you can chain includes to get further along the data model.  For example an `include=competitions,seasons` in a fixtures call will return the competition resource as the competition resourceType/id block is returned in the season resource.

The list of available inclusions are


 code            | Resource 
 -----            | ----- 
 `competitions`|Competitions
 `entities`      | Entities 
 `entityGroups`|Entity Groups
 `fixtures`|Fixtures
 `leagues`       | Leagues 
 `organizations` | Organizations 
 `persons`|Persons
 `sites`|Sites
 `seasons`|Seasons
 `seasonPools`|Pools
 `seasonStages`|Stages
 `seasonRounds`|Rounds
 `venues`|Venues

## External Ids

The API allows certain end-points to be accessed via the externalId as supplied by the user.  

The external parameter when used, lists the Ids that are to be replaced.

    /v1/sport/org/1/competitions/NL?external=competitionId

Below are a list of all the Ids that can be replaced.  These Ids can be replaced in GET, POST, PUT & DELETE calls.
* competitionId
* seasonId
* fixtureId
* siteId
* venueId
* entityGroupId
* entityId
* personId

The allowable format of an externalId is any character except:
* / (forward slash)
* ? (question mark)
* & (ampersand)

## Date formats

The API only accepts dates formatted in the ISO-8601 standard. These dates should be sent with **no** timezone qualifier. The correct timezone will be implied by the context of the call.

**Example:**

 For dates with a time component

     YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.s eg. 2017-06-29T18:20:00.00

 For dates with no time component

     YYYY-MM-DD eg. 2017-06-29

where  
 YYYY = four-digit year  
 MM = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)  
 DD = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)  
 hh = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)   
 mm = two digits of minute (00 through 59)   
 ss = two digits of second (00 through 59)   
 s = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second  

## UUIDs

The majority of objects in the API use a [universally unique identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) (uuid) as an identifier.  The uuid is a number, represented as 32 hexadecimal digits. There are a number of different versions of the uuid, but this API uses only uuid version 1.

When a new record (that uses a uuid) is created, this uuid can be generated by the client and included in the POST call.  If left blank, it will be automatically created by the server and return it in the response.

An example uuid is: `206c7392-b05f-11e8-96f8-529269fb1459`

## Images

Some API calls will return image objects for things such as logos or photos.  The url field of the image object contains the url where you will find that image.  This url is for the 'default' version of the image.  There are some query string parameters available to change how the image is returned.

`format`

 By default the image is returned in whatever format it was uploaded in, but by specifying the 'format' parameter you can change this.  Valid options are: `png`, `jpg`, `webp`.

`size`

By default the image is returned as a square of 100x100 pixels.  By specifying the 'size' parameter the image will be returned at a difference size.  The available options are

size parameter | dimensions
 -----            | -----
`100` | 100x100
`200` | 200x200
`400` | 400x400
`800` | 800x800
`1000` | 1000x1000
`RAW` | The original dimensions that the image was uploaded with

Images will not be scaled up. If you ask for an image with `size=400`, but the image is only 200x200 then the image will be returned as 200x200.

All images returned (apart from `size=RAW`) are square. If the original image that is uploaded is not square, then it is padded with a transparent (white for jpg) background.

An example url is: `https://img.dc.atriumsports.com/586aa6b195d243c4ae4154c8a61eda19?size=200&format=webp`

More detailed information about each component is available in that section of the API documentation.

## Fixture Status Flow

Each fixture can have one of the following status values:
  * **IF_NEEDED** - Only played if needed
  * **BYE** - Entity has no fixture scheduled for this group of fixtures
  * **SCHEDULED** - Yet to be played
  * **PENDING** - Ready to start
  * **WARM_UP** - Players have begun to warm up
  * **ON_PITCH** - Players are on the playing field
  * **IN_PROGRESS** - Currently in play
  * **FINISHED** - Fixture finished but not yet 'official'
  * **CONFIRMED** - Fixture officially completed
  * **POSTPONED** - Will be played at a future time
  * **CANCELLED** - Will not be played
  * **ABANDONED** - Fixture began but had to be stopped
  
<img src="https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/activity/(start)-|a|,|a|->(IF_NEEDED)->(SCHEDULED),|a|->(BYE)->(SCHEDULED),|a|->(SCHEDULED)->(PENDING)->(WARM_UP)->(IN_PROGRESS)->(FINISHED)->(CONFIRMED)->(end),(SCHEDULED)->(CANCELLED)->(end),(SCHEDULED)->(ABANDONED)->(end),(SCHEDULED)->(POSTPONED)->(end),(IN_PROGRESS)->(ABANDONED)->(end)" >

## Limits/Throttling

All API requests are limited/throttled to prevent abuse and ensure stability.  There are two types of limiting in place:
 1. Usage Limits/Quota
    As a customer you would have been given a number of API calls that you are allowed to make each month. If you exceed this limit then your request will fail.
 2. Rate Limits
    As part of your plan you will also have limits as to how often you can make particular calls. For example you may only be able to call a particular endpoint once per minute.  If you exceed these limits then your request will fail.

# Authorization

This API uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize calls. OAuth is an open standard that many companies use to provide secure access to protected resources.

When you created an application in our management systems you would have been provided with an OAuth client ID and secret key.  By using these credentials and other parameters in a [get token](#token) call you will receive back an **access token**. 

This **access token** must then be sent in the `Authorization` header for each subsequent API call.  Access tokens have a finite life and will expire. When the token expires you will need to create a new token to make more API calls.  Creation of tokens is rate-limited, so you should use the existing token as long as possible.
