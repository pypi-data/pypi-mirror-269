  muted the alarm that was triggered when the device is not
  responding anymore.

  muted the alarm system that was triggered when the device has
  detected a movement or a location change while the security level
  is set to ``active``.

* ``security_level`` (optional): indicate the current level of
  security of this device:

  * ``1``: indicate that the alarm system of the device is active,
    which is an alarm that the user manually arms when he leaves his
    vehicle. The user will be urgently alerted of any movement of his
    vehicle.

  * ``0``: indicate that the alarm system of the device is

    after a few seconds.  The user will be gently notified of any
