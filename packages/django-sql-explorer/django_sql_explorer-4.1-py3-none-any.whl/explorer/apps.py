    # Django doesn't actually have a way of running code on application initialization, so we have come up with this.
    # The app.ready() method (the call site for this function) is invoked *before* any migrations are run. So if were
    # to just call this function in ready(), without the try: block, then it would always fail the very first time
    # Django runs (and e.g. in test runs) because no tables have yet been created. The intuitive way to handle this with
    # Django would be to tie into the post_migrate signal in ready() and run this function on post_migrate. But that
    # doesn't work because that signal is only called if indeed a migrations has been applied. If the app restarts and
    # there are no new migrations, the signal never fires. So instead we check if the Query table exists, and if it
    # does, we're good to gather stats.
