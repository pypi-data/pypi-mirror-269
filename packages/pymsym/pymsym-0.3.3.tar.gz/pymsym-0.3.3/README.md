# pymsym
libmsym is a C library dealing with point group symmetry in molecules. pymsym is its python interface.

## about
this library was originally developed by Marcus Johansson. the original library can be found [here](https://github.com/mcodev31/libmsym) and seems unmaintained - after reaching out to the initial authors, i've decided to fork this so i can maintain it.

## api

see ``test/test.py`` for a low-frills introduction to the api, or the original repo for more details. i haven't modified the api at all.
